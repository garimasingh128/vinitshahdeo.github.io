# Hola, I'm Vinit Shahdeo

## Glad to see you here!

### About Me

Technology never scares, it always attracts! Passionate about simplifying things through technology. Proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms and love to solve problems that involve creativity and innovation. Entered this world as a fresher, made significant progress in self-learning new technologies at a faster pace of time and implementing them in the projects.

Currently I am working as a Software Engineer towards the mission of creating an API-First universe. I work with all kinds of modern JavaScript (React, NodeJS etc). Over and above, I possess accountable knowledge of OOPs concepts.

My charitable motivation, coupled with a passion for what I am doing, inspires me for open source. I am addicted to green dots on GitHub. You can find my contributions here: github.com/vinitshahdeo

I love experimenting and developing using new and challenging technologies. It's a great feeling for me when I am able to help someone. I love to mentor people.

> Well this is what it is on the professional front, numbers and figures stacked up. But let me throw light on what makes me. This section isn't about me going ga-ga over my achievements. It is about how the journey so far has shaped me to a person I am today. It is about all the bits and bytes that make me. Yes I am a tech geek but with a difference! An equal interest in Art, Culture and Music. I wish to see the world as if everything is a miracle. Firstly, I am grateful for the tiny treasure I have in my life - a roof on my head, a safe environment, a sustainable future, the right to education and opportunities to extract the best out of it, few but faithful friends and I hope to give back to society by doing my job as an IT professional. <br> <br> Throughout the years I have moulded myself to fight fear with hope, arrogance
							with confidence, thoughts with actions, actions with response and pessimism with optimism. I
							have a deep abiding love for learning, building and designing things. I consistently set
							short-term goals for myself. Then, once Iâ€™ve defined the benchmarks, I take necessary steps
							to achieve those milestones. Being tireless seeker of knowledge, I always look at where I
							can improve and strive for perfection in things which I do. I enjoy my ongoing tasks and
							multitasking. I always keep an eye on my target. <br><br> My father has always been the Larry Summers to my inner Sheryl Sandberg, the
							iron pillar in my life. It was him who told me to raise my words and not my voice, who not
							only encouraged me to stand up and speak but also expected me to sit quietly and listen. And
							who made this silent timid boy into the one you see in front of you today. And he is
							confident and ready to take on the world that awaits. <br><br>I love to interact with people
							and share whatever little I know about my subjects and quite often can be found blogging on
							<a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vinit-Shahdeo-1" target="_blank">Quora</a> and <a
								href="https://medium.com/@vinitshahdeo" target="_blank">Medium</a>. <br><br> When I am not <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/vinitshahdeo"
								target="_blank">coding</a> I can often be found on the field playing badminton or lost
							in the healing world of music. Ping me, nothing brings me more joy than being able to
							connect with new people and to expand my network. <br><br>Always happy to help!
