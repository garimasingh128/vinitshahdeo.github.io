### About Me

Technology never scares, it always attracts! Passionate about simplifying things through technology. Proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms and love to solve problems that involve creativity and innovation. Entered this world as a fresher, made significant progress in self-learning new technologies at a faster pace of time and implementing them in the projects.

Currently I am working as a Software Engineer towards the mission of creating an API-First universe. I work with all kinds of modern JavaScript (React, NodeJS etc). Over and above, I possess accountable knowledge of OOPs concepts.

My charitable motivation, coupled with a passion for what I am doing, inspires me for open source. I am addicted to green dots on GitHub. You can find my contributions here: github.com/vinitshahdeo

I love experimenting and developing using new and challenging technologies. It's a great feeling for me when I am able to help someone. I love to mentor people.
